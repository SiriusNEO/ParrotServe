class SemanticVariable:
    """Semantic Variable: the core abstraction in Parrot system.

    Its main purpose is to chunk a LLM request into smaller pieces, so that
    we can do fine-grained management and optimization.

    Definition: a Semantic Variable (SV) is a part of prompts with specific semantic
    purpose. A SV can be:
    - 1. A system prompt of a request (Also called prefix).
    - 2. A user-input of a request (Also called an input / a parameter of a function).
    - 3. An output location of a request (Also called a return value of a function).
    - 4. A communication port of two LLM Agents.
    - 5. A few-shot example of a request.
    - ...

    For input/output SVs, they are like "Future" in the Python asynchronous programming,
    or "Promise" in JavaScript.

    The motivation is that the prompt itself is structural, and can be split into
    different independent parts with different semantic purposes.
