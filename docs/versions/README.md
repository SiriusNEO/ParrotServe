# Versions of Parrot

Parrot, as a project, went through many refactors and modifications. Majorly, there are three versions since Parrot was originally developed. You can see the docs here to have a short glance of our line of thought when designing / developing Parrot

- [V1](v1.md): It's the first version and contains many ideas we didn't preserve in our final version.
- [V2](v2.md): The second version aligns with our paper and artifact, which implements most of the features but still not mature enough.
- [V3 (Currently)](v3.md): It's a stable version of Parrot, also, the current version in the main branch.
